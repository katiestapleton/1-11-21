    ### Assignment for Today 01/11 (due at midnight tonight)

[U2 Lab 2: Exploring a MongoDB database](https://skilledkc.valor.training/mod/assign/view.php?id=11657)

In this assignment, we'll create a recipe database - this time in Mongo instead of SQL.  Please follow these instructions instead of the instructions listed in the assignment:

1. This lab is going to be relatively simple, since this is all new. We're going to create a recipe ingredients database with Mongoose similar to the SQL database from before.
2. Create the mongoose schema and model
7. Insert 3 new recipes and their ingredients, amounts, and measures in to the Database
8. Write a query to get a list of all the Recipes
9. Write a query to get a list of Recipes that use a certain Ingredient
10. Write a query to update a recipe you added
7. Comment the code and clearly explain what the script is doing.
8. Put your  commands in a file in a Github repo and submit the repo link to Lab 2
